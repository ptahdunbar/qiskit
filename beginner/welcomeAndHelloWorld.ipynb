    "In this notebook, we'll focus on teaching you how to manage the general flow of setting up, running, and evaluating the results of your quantum code. We'll also include some details about the proper way to configure each notebook you encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each notebook has exercises where you will be asked to fill in your own Qiskit code. There will be occasional hints, but it is up to you to talk with other people at your Qiskit Fall Fest event and solve each exercise. It's important to note that you should run each code cell, even if you didn't write any new code. This ensures that when you submit your answers later on, everything is up to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook you are looking at is called a Jupyter Notebook, and it's really useful for writing text and code right next to each other. To complete this and the other notebooks, you'll need to know a little bit about the Python programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever used Python before? If the answer is \"yes\" - feel free to skip forward to the Install Qiskit section. If you have never used Python before, you will definitely struggle with these notebooks. We recommend you go learn the basics of Python before continuing."

    "Congratulations on making it to the end of the first Qiskit Fall Fest notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "You learned how to follow the workflow of Qiskit patterns to set up, optimize, run, and process your circuit. You successfully created a two-qubit Bell state, and showed that it was properly entangled by visualizing the operators. You learned how to use the auto-grader as well. Rock on!\n",
    "\n",
    "With the basics down, you’re now ready to begin thinking like a quantum developer. It’s a little different than thinking like a quantum physicist, though. We’re not just making discoveries about how the world works—we’re trying to use quantum mechanics as a tool to solve meaningful problems and enact positive change in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "We like to say we’ve entered the era of quantum utility—for the first time, quantum computers can do things beyond the abilities of brute-force classical computing. Now, we’re looking for quantum advantage, where quantum computers are the best way to solve the problem. We need you, the quantum community for that—we need to uncover and implement quantum algorithms and apply them to real-world use cases. The rest of the challenge will be devoted to that—getting you to start thinking like a quantum developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "And of course, solving problems with real-world impact means thinking about who you’re impacting and how. At IBM we hold that we must research and develop technology responsibly. To that end, quantum computing and ethics experts at IBM have been researching the societal implications of quantum computing, and our role as a quantum computing provider in mitigating potentially undesired consequences of the technology. We encourage you to learn more by reading about our Responsible Quantum Computing effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enjoy the rest of your Qiskit Fall Fest event, and good luck!"
